## Project Introduction

This project was created to fill a tooling gap in my roles at Home Serve USA. The roles I performed at the company were Repair Management Coordinator taking inbound service requests and handling complaints in the Office of the President. Both are customer facing roles that require documentation of customer information in multiple systems that often fail.  

Because of the consistent errors or bugs that would occur in these systems agents would often lose notes and must start claims over or redo documentation from scratch. This caused a lot of errors in the documentation itself and often resulted in incorrect claims being made as issues were not quite remembered correctly. The only solution at the time when I first started at the company was to open notepad or a word document and type notes manually editing and formatting every time.  

The small program I created was made to be run just from a single html file to run lightly and help with basic formatting, a few snippets, email templating, as well as just a simple place to keep notes persistent until you can copy and paste them into the other systems in case they went down during the call. 

Though simple, the tool at the time of writing is used by me and a decent number of agents that like the formatting and flow of the tool. In this series of posts, I will document some of the code that helped make this happen, mainly for me to look back on when making improvements as well as a sort of repository for reusable features of the tool.
